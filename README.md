calendar-math
=============

This is a rough outline of html files used to sketch out the Time Engine, which is my idea for my main project for bootcamp. See that repository for the full project. 


The framework for first web app. Given a fixed number of sessions, determine end date, or given an end date, determine how many sessions per day.

I'm making my first full stack web app as part of the PDX Code Guild Developer boot camp. 

The calendar math app is one of many ideas I have. 

Purpose:

Given a fixed number of sessions, which could be meetings in a series, chapters in a book, lectures in a class, etc., and a start date, figure out when you'll finish the series or class. 

And/Or

Given an end date and a series of sessions, chapters, lessons, etc. determine how many sessions/hours you'd need each day in order to complete the series by the deadline. 

I hope to eventually add options to opt out of weekends, pick which days work happens etc.

Results will be viewed on a calendar or timeline (not sure yet). Might explore different visulaization tecniques.
