                    Figure out how long a series of classes will take you to complete! You have two choices:</p>

                <h3><a href="cal_by_sessions.html">Option 1</a></h3>


                <p>
                   Enter the number of sessions, and find out when you'll be done!
                </p>


                <h3><a href="cal_by_date.html">Option 2</a></h3>

                <p>
                    Enter the deadline--the date you need to finish by--and find out how much you'll need to accomplish each day.
